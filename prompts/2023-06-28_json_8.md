Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction: 
Extract the following information from the text in input:
1. Category
2. Title
3. GEO
4. Audience
5. Publication date
6. Article ID
7. Effective date

You must format your output as a JSON value that adheres to a given "JSON Schema" instance.
"JSON Schema" is a declarative language that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents.
As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}} the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema.
The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.
Here is the output schema: {"type" : "object", "properties" : {"category": {"type": "string"}, "title": {"type": "string"}, "geo": {"type": "string"}, "audience": {"type": "string"}, "publication_date": {"type": "string", "format": "date"}, "article-id" : {"type" : "string", "maxLength": 7}, "effective-date" : {"type" : "string", "format" : "date"}, "mark-your-calendar-date" : {"type" : "string", "format" : "date"}}}
Your output will be parsed and type-checked according to the provided schema instance, so make sure all fields in your output match exactly!
